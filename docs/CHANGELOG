CHANGES between 1.3.0 and 1.2.7-patched
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

- Updated the "database abstraction layer" from an outdated version of
  the unmaintained PEAR::DB module to the most recent version of
  PEAR::MDB2 (which is currently 2.4.0). Please read the README file
  for important information about upgrading from 1.2.7-patched. It
  will not break anything if you don't, but it won't work either. :)

- Added multi-language support, using php's gettext functionality. A 
  first Dutch translation has been added, along with English. See for
  more details docs/README.i18n.

- Removed the so-called "sequence updater". The code has been changed
  to use the auto increment functionalitiy in both mysql ang pgsql. It 
  is only tested on these backends, other backends are untested and
  may be unsupported. See docs/README.sequence for more details on
  inserting records and zones into the powerdns database when using
  other tools than poweradmin as well.

- Fixed a bug in search.php. When searching for a string it would
  return matching records, not the matching domains.

- Started cleanup code and files. For example, remove code and files
  related to "migration from a stone-age version of poweradmin",
  removal of the file called "BAKrecords.php", removal of code
  comments of already implemented todo's, etc.
