RedHat 8.0 BUG and howto 'fix'

Ok it seems to be that there is some bug in PowerAdmin (for now we assume so).
It is currently reported all on RedHat 8.0 machines.

The bug seems to be appear when Apache 2.0 is being used with the default
installed PHP RPM on the platform. New shapshots might remove this bug. We havent
tested this yet. If you have any more insights on this bug please email us
at info@poweradmin.sjeemz.nl

We kindly refer you to http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=18648
We havent tested this out fully yet! Not even the fix since we arent native
RedHat users.

Quick dirty fix. We just avoid the bug by not using php :)

NOTE: THIS IS A MYSQL FIX!

Ok what to do:

- Login to mysql using the poweradmin account information.
- Issue the following queries:


/****************
 * USER TABLE	*
 ***************/

CREATE TABLE users (
id int(11) NOT NULL,
username varchar(16) NOT NULL default '',
password varchar(255) NOT NULL default '',
fullname varchar(255) NOT NULL default '',
email varchar(255) NOT NULL default '',
description text NOT NULL,
level tinyint(4) NOT NULL default '0',
active tinyint(4) NOT NULL default '0',
PRIMARY KEY  (id)
) TYPE=MyISAM;

/****************
 * ZONES TABLE	*
 ***************/

CREATE TABLE zones (
id int(11) NOT NULL,
name varchar(255) NOT NULL default '',
owner int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
comment text NOT NULL,
PRIMARY KEY  (id)
) TYPE=MyISAM;



/************************
 * INSTALL YOURSELF	*
 ***********************/

- $login == your prefered login
- $full	== your fullname
- $pass == your prefered password
- $email == your prefered email
- $desc == your prefered description

INSERT INTO users VALUES (1,'$login',md5('$pass'),'$full','$email','$description',10,1)

Example
INSERT INTO users VALUES (1,'trance',md5('test'),'me','trancer@nospam.trancer.nl','its me!',10,1);

- Ok, now we have a problem. PowerAdmin uses PEAR. And to remain independent PEAR has
its own incrementation functions. For this there is a seperate table. We didnt use pear yet, therefore
the current setup is inconsistent with what pear is thinking (you are one id behind).
We now have to setup a users_seq table for this.


CREATE TABLE users_seq (
  id int(10) unsigned NOT NULL auto_increment,
  PRIMARY KEY  (id)
) TYPE=MyISAM;

INSERT INTO users_seq VALUES (1);


Done! It should now work. If you encounter any problems feel free to email us, also monitor the website
bugfixes might come available.
